description: |
  Ceilometer project aims to become the infrastructure to collect measurements
  within OpenStack so that no two agents would need to be written to collect
  the same data. It's primary targets are monitoring and metering, but the
  framework should be easily expandable to collect for other needs. To that
  effect, Ceilometer should be able to share collected data with a variety
  of consumers.
