summary: Failover and monitoring daemon for LVS clusters
maintainer: Micha≈Ç Sawicz <michal.sawicz@canonical.com>
description: |
  keepalived is used for monitoring real servers within a Linux Virtual
  Server (LVS) cluster.  keepalived can be configured to remove real
  servers from the cluster pool if it stops responding, as well as send
  a notification email to make the admin aware of the service failure.
  In addition, keepalived implements an independent Virtual Router
  Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2; see rfc2338 for additional info)
  framework for director failover.
